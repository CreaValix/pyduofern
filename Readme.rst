=========

These are my efforts in porting the `FHEM <http://fhem.de/fhem.html>`_
`Duofern USB-Stick <https://wiki.fhem.de/wiki/DUOFERN>`_ based module to
`Homeassistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`_.

I prefer Python over perl and would like to use my Duofern blinds with
Homeassistant.


Installation:
=============

To install the python module run ``python setup.py install`` if you downloaded
the sources already or use the convenience mechanism and run::

     pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/gluap/pyduofern.git

Usage:
