pyduofern
=========

These are my efforts in porting the `FHEM <http://fhem.de/fhem.html>`_
`Duofern USB-Stick <https://wiki.fhem.de/wiki/DUOFERN>`_ based module to
`Homeassistant <https://home-assistant.io/>`_. As of now the port is rather ugly, but it is usable enough to control
my Duofern blinds. I did not port the Weather-Station related features of the original module -- Mainly because I
do not own the corresponding hardware and have no means to test if it works.

I do not provide any guarantees for the usability of this software. Use at your own risk.

Getting Started
===============

To install the python module run ``python setup.py install`` if you downloaded
the sources already or use the convenience mechanism and run::

     pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/gluap/pyduofern.git

udev configuration
==================
to make your usb stick easily to identify deploy an `udev rules <https://wiki.debian.org/udev>`_ file in
``/etc/udev/rules.d/98-duofern.rules`` or the equivalent of your distribution. The following worked for my
stick::

    SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", ATTRS{serial}=="WR04ZFP4", SYMLINK+="duofernstick"

Once the rule is deployed your stick should show up as ``/dev/duofernstick`` as soon as you plug it in. This
helps avoid confusion if you use other usb-serial devices.

Getting
=====
To start using your stick you can use the ``duofern_cli.py`` script which should have been installed together
with the pyduofern module. Begin by chosing a 4 hex-digit system code. Ideally write it down, if you forget
it, you will likely have to chose a new system code and reset your devices in order to be able to pair them again.
